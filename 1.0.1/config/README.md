# My Project Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for the project. The main configuration file is `default.json`, which holds the default settings for the application.

## Configuration Files

- **default.json**: This file contains the default configuration settings used throughout the application. It is structured in JSON format and can be modified to suit different environments.

## Usage

To utilize the configuration settings in your application, import the necessary configuration files where needed. Ensure that any sensitive information is managed securely and not hard-coded into the configuration files.

## Best Practices

- Keep sensitive data out of version control by using environment variables.
- Document any changes made to the configuration files to maintain clarity for future developers.
